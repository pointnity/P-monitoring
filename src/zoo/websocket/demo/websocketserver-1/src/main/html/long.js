    // The internal representation of a long is the two given signed, 32-bit values.
    // We use 32-bit pieces because these are the size of integers on which
    // Javascript performs bit-operations.  For operations like addition and
    // multiplication, we split each number into 16 bit pieces, which can easily be
    // multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow
    // or change in sign.
    //
    // In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the
    // positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.
    // Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE
    // (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as
    // a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this
    // case would often result in infinite recursion.
    //
    // Common constant values ZERO, ONE, NEG_ONE, etc. are defined below the from*
    // methods on which they depend.
